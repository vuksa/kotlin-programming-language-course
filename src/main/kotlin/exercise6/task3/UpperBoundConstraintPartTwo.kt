/**
 * Task 3: Upper-Bound Constraints II
 *
 * In this task, you need to add a constraint to the generic type parameter of function estimateIntersectionSize,
 * so that the function body becomes compilable. The function estimates the size of the intersection of
 * two sets of values by comparing the upper and lower bounds of values in both sets.
 * The function will work only if the value type supports total ordering, and the task is to specify this constraint.
 * A tricky part is the expected upper bound itself is a generic interface, and its type parameter will be exactly
 * the same as the function type parameter, that is, the type parameter becomes recursive.
 *
 * Once the type constraint is introduced, the code of estimateIntersectionSize function will become compilable.
