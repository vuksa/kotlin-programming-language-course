/**
 * Task 4" Upper-Bound Constraints III
 *
 * In this task, we still want to add a constraint to the generic type parameters of function estimateIntersectionSize,
 * so that the function body became compilable. However, the difference is that now the function argument is a tree node
 * that contains a value of a generic type, not necessarily a SetIntersection instance.
 * Type parameter constraints should combine a few interfaces that the values in the tree nodes are supposed to implement.
 * We will use a where keyword to define the constraints.
 *
 * Once the type constraint is introduced, the code of estimateIntersectionSize
 * function will become compilable without additional changes.
 *
 * Also, you need to add a simple type constraint into printTree function so that it could traverse and
 * print trees composed of the values of different types, e.g., SetIntersection and Decision.
