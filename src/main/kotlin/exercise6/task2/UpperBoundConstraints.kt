 * Task 2: The Upper-Bound Constraints
 *
 * In this task, you need to add a constraint to the generic type parameter of function calculateTreeCost,
 * so that the function body becomes compilable. The function calculates a sum of costs of all tree nodes,
 * and we want to be able to call it with trees holding values of a different type.
 *
 * Once the type constraint is introduced, the code of calculateTreeCost function will become compilable.
