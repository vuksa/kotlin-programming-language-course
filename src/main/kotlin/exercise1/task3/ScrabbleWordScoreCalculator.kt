/**
 * Task 3:
 * In Scrabble, each letter has a corresponding point value. To calculate the score of a word,
 * you sum up the point values of each letter in the word according to the following table:
 *
 * Score Table:
 * ```
 * 1  Point:  A, E, I, O, U, L, N, R, S, T
 * 2  Points: D, G
 * 3  Points: B, C, M, P
 * 4  Points: F, H, V, W, Y
 * 5  Points: K
 * 8  Points: J, X
 * 10 Points: Q, Z
 *```
 * For example, the word 'faculty' has a Scrabble score of 15, as the following mappings apply:
 * ```
 *    'f' = 4
 *    'a' = 1
 *    'c' = 3
 *    'u' = 1
 *    'l' = 1
 *    't' = 1
 *    'y' = 4
 *  Total: 15
 *```
 * Assignment: Implement the [calculateWordScrabbleScore] function, so that it returns the Scrabble score for a given
 * [word]. It is guaranteed that the [word] contains only characters in the range from 'a' to 'z'.
 *
